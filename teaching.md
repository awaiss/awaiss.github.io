# 🎓 **Teaching Philosophy**
My teaching approach is based on:

### ✔ **Concept → Application → Innovation**
Students learn foundational theory, implement ideas through programming, and then apply these skills to real-world engineering or AI problems.

### ✔ **Hands-on Learning**
I emphasize programming tasks, lab work, and real datasets to help students understand practical challenges.

### ✔ **Research-Integrated Teaching**
My lectures often include examples from real tomography, machine learning, and industrial automation research to give students exposure to cutting-edge techniques.

### ✔ **Student-Centered Delivery**
I encourage critical thinking, curiosity, and problem-solving through discussions, projects, and open-ended assignments.
